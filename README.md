# sierpinksi-triangle-chaos
Forming a Sierpiński triangle in Python using the chaos game method and pygame library.
The Sierpiński triangle is a fractal described by Sierpiński in 1915. It can be created using the following chaos game method: 
1. Draw an equilateral triangle and mark a random initial point.  
2. Mark the next point midway to one of the vertices of the triangle, chosen randomly. 
3. Repeat step 2 until the form eventually emerges.
